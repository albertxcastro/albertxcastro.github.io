            Recruiting is a multifaceted process that involves assessing various factors beyond resumes, such as cultural fit, communication skills, and subjective qualities. Human recruiters bring valuable context, intuition, and ethical considerations to decision-making, which AI algorithms cannot easily replicate. Human judgment can help identify and mitigate potential biases, ensure fairness, and consider individual circumstances that AI algorithms may not capture.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, from Rute's inputs, there should be more regulation to improve AI systems applied to recruitment to ensure transparency (Hunkenschroer, A., 2021). 
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize various domains, including recruiting, it is essential to recognize that incorporating a human-in-the-loop approach can enhance the ethical and responsible use of AI in decision-making processes.
