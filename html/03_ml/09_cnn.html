        <h3>Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
		<p>
			A convolutional neural network is a deep learning algorithm that is widely used in computer vision to classify images. These types of artificial 
			neural networks are capable of learn patterns in the input images (textures and edges) and is able to differentiate one from another (Saha, 2018).
			<br>
			<br>

			Unlike multi-level perceptrons, convolutional neural networks are specialized to work with grid data, such as images or videos. This is because it 
			uses a mathematical operation called convolution that allows it to capture spatial and temporal dependencies (Saha, 2018).
		</p>

		<h4>Convolution</h4>
		In the context on convolutional neural networks, the convolution is the mathematical operation used to extract patterns from input data, such as edges or 
		textures. This is achieved by convoluting the input image with a kernel or filter. The kernel is a matrix of weights we use as a sliding window to 
		move over the input image. On each location we multiply each value of the kernel ith the overlaped values from the input image and after thar we sum the results 
		to get a single numerical value. After performing this operation over the whole input image, we get as result an matrix of numerical values called feature map.
