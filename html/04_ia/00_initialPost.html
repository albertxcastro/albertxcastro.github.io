        <h3>Agent Based Systems - Initial Post</h3>
        <p>
            
Wooldridge (2009) describes in his book how the world wide web inventor imagined that machines could semantically analyze data content in websites. We can see this semantical analysis when discussing how e-commerce websites use intelligent agents to recommend products or content to users based on their historical interests.
<br><br>
Nowadays, almost every online website or service has automatic recommendations, such as streaming services or online stores. Recommender systems provide these recommendations and also provide impact both users and website owners. (Ricci et al., 2011).
<br><br>
Users benefit from recommender systems since they improve user experience using online websites. On the other hand, companies can use recommendations to improve user experience and their unit economics: user retention, conversion rate, and a boost in sales while keeping users happy by giving them relevant content (Ricci et al., 2011).
<br><br>
However, although recommender systems are excellent tools for improving companies' metrics, they come with several challenges. For example, giant retailers such as Amazon or AliExpress may have enormous amounts of data but still need to produce real-time recommendations, creating infrastructure scalability problems. On the other hand, the lack of data for new users can lead to low-quality recommendations (Linden et al., 2003).
<br><br>
Additionally, recommender systems can negatively impact both consumers and the companies running them. For example, consumers can be exposed to privacy risks, which leads to a loss of consumer trust ad societal trust in the company. Moreover, recommender systems are trained with existing consumer data, potentially leading to learning harmful data patterns and biased recommender algorithms that discriminate against certain user groups (Ricci et al., 2011).
<br><br>
In conclusion, recommender systems can benefit organizations with online services. However, there is still room for improvement regarding AI applications' safety and ethical development.
