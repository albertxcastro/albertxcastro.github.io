        <h3>Creating Agent Dialogues</h3>
		Create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).
<br>
<br>
		Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.
		<br>
		<br>

		The solution can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/albertxcastro/SuperSimpleKQMLDIalogue/tree/main">GitHub repo</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		The solution implements a super class <strong>Agent</strong> and two derived classes <strong>Bob</strong> and <strong>Alice</strong>.
	In the main script, both agents are instantiated and also injected a message queue they use for asynchronous communication.

		<br>
		Additionally, <strong>Bob</strong> is injected its knowledge base of televisions that represents the stock, and also messages
		between agents are set up.
		<br>
		I tried to follow an object-oriented design to simplify the code. After executing the code, this is the output.
