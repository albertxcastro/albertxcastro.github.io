        <h3>Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages - Summary Post</h3>
		Hi Leigh, thank you for your post!
		I have to admit I was speaking a bit from ignorance. After I went through the lectures to complete the assignment in Unit 6, I realized what you mentioned about distributed systems. Even though they can communicate via APIs, those are transactional requests and responses, and the client and server must know the payload they will use to communicate. Still, in the case of intelligent agents, sometimes they do not know about the existence of other agents. However, they should still be able to communicate.
		<br>
		<br>
		I am not sure if it is a good example. Still, I saw on social media somebody speaking about how video game companies like Rockstar Games have to handle how objects will behave within the game. Still, there are hundreds of things, and each of them can behave differently from other objects. I mentioned Rockstar Games because a famous glitch occurs when you put a car very close to a swingset (BLG, 2022). This is an example of a communication failure between agents (the card and the swingset), where each agent does not have explicit knowledge of the other but can still interact.
