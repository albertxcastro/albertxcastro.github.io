        <h3>Agent Architectures</h3>

		Maes (1991) states that an architecture is a methodology or process utilized for building software, including how a piece of software can be decomposed into internal modules and how these modules interact.

		<h4>But first... what is an agent?</h4>
        <p>
		Russel & Norving (2021), an agent is a piece of software or computational system capable of perceiving, processing information, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. It can operate autonomously, making decisions based on reasoning, internal knowledge, and environmental information.
		Although the concept of intelligent agents has evolved, an intelligent agent's key components are perception, cognition, and action.
			<ol>
			<li>Perception is related to the agent's ability to scan/perceive its environment through sensors or cameras.</li>
			<li>Cognition refers to the agent's ability to process information and make decisions. It can be achieved using AI algorithms, machine learning techniques, or logical reasoning.</li>
			<li>Action represents the agent's ability to perform actions based on internal reasoning, which is critical to achieving the agent's goals or objectives.</li>
		</ol>
		Intelligent agents are widely used in the industry, including domains like robotics, self-driven vehicles, domotics, and virtual assistants, among many other applications.

		<br>
		<br>
		<h5>Types of agents</h5>
		There are mainly three types of agents
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Symbolic reasoning agents</strong>: Agents that are perceived as a knowledge-base system that rely on symbolic reasoning to perform actions.</li>
			<li><strong>Reactive agents</strong>: Stateless agents that only react to signals taken from their environment.</li>
			<li><strong>Hybrid agents</strong>: Agents that take the best features from synbolic and reactive agents.</li>
		</ul>
        </p>

		<h5>Practical reasoning architectures</h5>
		A well established architecture is the BDI (Belief Desire Intentions) architecture. BDI agents are equiped with beliefs, desires and intentions (Bratman, 1988).
