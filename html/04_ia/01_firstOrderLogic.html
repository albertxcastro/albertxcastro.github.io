        <h3>First order logic</h3>
        <p>

			First-order logic is a fundamental framework in symbolic logic, enabling the precise and rigorous representation of statements concerning objects and their relationships. Its extensive application spans diverse fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and linguistics. This logic system articulates statements effectively using quantifiers, variables, predicates, and logical connectives. (Enderton, 2001).
<br><br>
			There are different components utilized for representing statements:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Variables: Variables are placeholders that can take different values in specific domains. They are typically represented with lowercase letters such as x and y.
			</li>
			<li>
				Quantifiers: Quantifiers express the scope of a variable. There are two main quantifiers used in first-order logic:
				<ul>
					<li>Universal (∀): Represents "for all" or "for every". It expresses something true for all elements in a domain.</li>
					<li>Existential (∃): Represents "there exists". It expresses that at least one element exists in a value domain holding a true value.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Predicates: Predicates are propositions containing variables that transform into meaningful statements when variables are assigned values. They are typically represented with uppercase letters and can take one or more arguments, for instance, P(x), D(x, y).
			</li>
			<li>
				Logical connectors: Logical connectors combine predicates and build more complex statements.
				<ul>
					<li><strong>AND (∧)</strong>: Represents logical conjunction.</li>
					<li><strong>OR (∨):</strong> Represents logical disjunction.</li>
					<li><strong>NOT (¬):</strong> Represents negation.</li>
					<li><strong>Implication (→):</strong> Represents "if...then" statements.</li>
					<li><strong>Biconditional (↔):</strong> Represents "if and only if" statements.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>


		<h4>Examples of first-order logic statements</h4>
		Let P(x) be the predicate "x can fly", and Q(x) "x is carnivore"
		<ol>
			<ul>Universal statement: <strong>∀x: P(x) → "Every x can fly."</strong></ul>
			<ul>Existential statement: <strong>∃x: Q(x) → "There exists x that is a carnivore."</strong></ul>
		</ol>
