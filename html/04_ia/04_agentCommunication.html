        <h3>Agent communication languages</h3>
		<h4>Speech act theory</h4>
		Speech act theory is an interdisciplinary field encompassing linguistics and philosophy. It examines how language is employed to carry out diverse actions. It centers on the performative nature of language, observing it as a powerful tool for influencing others, instead of a mere transmission of information (Austin, 1975).

		<h4>Agent communication languages</h4>
		An agent communication language (or ACL) is a language used by intelligent agents to interchange comunication and commands within a multi-agent system. It supports features interaction between agents to exchange information, negotiate, and collaborate.
		<br>
		<br>

		<h4>Knowledge query and manipulation language (KQML)</h4>
		KQML is a language designed to facilitate communication between autonomous agents within multi-agent systems.
		It allows to interchange complex message content between agents they can use to collaborate or negotiate and achieve their goals. Additionally, KQML offers synchronous and asynchronous communication channels that makes the implementation of agents more flexible (Finin, et al., 1993).
		<br>
		<br>

		It implements the performative aspects of the speech act theory:
		<ul>
			<li>Ask: This command allows agents to ask other agents about something that is true.</li>
			<li>Tell: This command allows agents to reply to ASK commands from other agents.</li>
			<li>Perform: This command allows agents to ask other agents to perform an action.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Ontologies</h4>
		According to Gruber (1993), in the context of intelligent agents, an ontology is a framework used for sharing knowledge between two or more agents. It serves as a formal domain used by agents to agree on concepts, relationships and properties that allow agents to interact between them with enough context.
