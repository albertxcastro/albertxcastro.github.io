			Thank you all for your valuable responses.
<br><br>
			In my original post, I emphasized the importance of ethics and professionalism in research and tried to highlight how close these two concepts are. I argued that Abi has an ethical obligation to present all his findings transparently, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. Focusing only on data that supports an idea or desired outcome is unprofessional and ethically questionable. To maintain research integrity, I argued that Abi must present his findings comprehensively, showing both favorable and non-favorable results.
			<br><br>
			However, one of my peers' responses brought an interesting perspective to the discussion. I should have considered interpreting research data as a complex task that cannot be described as good or bad, positive or negative. Analyzing research data is more complex, as research outcomes are mostly more complex than good or bad but inconclusive.
			<br><br>
			It taught me the importance of understanding that different statistical tests can produce different results even when applied to the same data. In this scenario, researchers, such as Abi, must present the results as inconclusive.
			<br><br>
			In conclusion, while Abi must maintain high ethical and professional standards by not ignoring data, it is also essential to recognize the complexities of data analysis and interpretation. I believe this dual understanding enriches our appreciation of the responsibilities that come with scientific research.
