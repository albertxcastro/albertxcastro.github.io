			Dark UX is a practice that tricks users (or manipulates them) into making decisions they would typically not make, and that is not in their best interests but in the website or mobile app owner's interests. It is generally seen as unethical within most professional codes of conduct in software and technology development, such as the ACM Code of Ethics and the British Computer Society Code of Conduct (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018).
<br>
<br>
			As stated by my peers, ideally, technology professionals should avoid these practices. However, in the real world, software engineers and engineering managers sometimes do it because they need to get the job done (Feaviour, 2023).
			<br>
			<br>
			Moreover, Bandy (2023) correctly states that getting the job done is not a justification to violate or bypass such an ethical issue like this.
			<br>
			<br>
			In summary, bad UX practices harm the credibility of both the owner/designer of the digital product and the credibility and trust of those who built it (Castro, 2023).
