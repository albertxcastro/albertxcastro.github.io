			Professionalism and ethics are closely related. Someone who wants to be considered professional must pay attention to ethics (Stahl et al., 2016).
<br><br>
			In any social or professional setting, hiding information is as unethical as lying. Of course, it would be dishonest for Abi to hide significant findings in his report. Several questions are asked about Abi's behavior, so let's split them.
			<br><br>
			First, Abi is aware that data supports that Whiz is harmful. Ignoring it to focus only on data that supports otherwise is unethical, dishonest, and detrimental to research: imagine someone else wanting to use Abi's results to fund their work. The problem with misleading content that gets published is that it achieves a level of respect and credibility, and researchers trust it unless they have the time to study it and try to prove it wrong critically (Altman, 1980).
			<br><br>
			Additionally, Abi has the responsibility to present positive and negative results. In the world of statistics, numbers are not just numbers. Instead, they can be individuals, patients, or things that can impact others (Lee et al., 2015). In this case, those numbers are about food that can be harmful and can affect the health of others.
			<br><br>
			Finally, Abi must behave with integrity and responsibility when presenting the results, even if their boss is not interested in acting ethically.
