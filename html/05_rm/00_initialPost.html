			Topic: Dark UX Patterns
			<br>
			<br>
			Dark UX patterns are designed to trick or push users to perform actions that are against their will but benefit the website owner or system they are using. Dark UX is a malicious practice that some UX designers use based on the understanding of human psychology (Sapio, 2020).
			<br>
			<br>
			According to Stahl et al. (2016), several ethical issues are implied regarding dark UX: professionalism, autonomy, consent, and trust.
			<br>
			<br>
			Regarding professionalism, computing professionals (software engineers, managers, quality assurance engineers, and UX designers) are expected to pay attention to ethics (Stahl et al., 2016). Moreover, the Software Engineering Code taken from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) lists eight principles that ensure the correct application of ethics in the design and development of digital products (Gotterbarn et al., 1997).
			<br>
			<br>
			Regarding autonomy, consent, and trust, Stahl et al. (2016) mention that users should have enough information to make decisions on their own and that the company owner (website owner) must be transparent enough so users can trust them, which enables users to understand the scope, risks, and benefits of their decisions.
			<br>
			<br>
			In conclusion, dark UX is a bad practice that violates several ethical principles listed above. Software development companies should create policies that do not allow the introduction of this kind of pattern to the development of digital products since it is harmful and malicious to final users.
